# Quick Fix Guide for ESLint Warnings

## 🚀 Fastest Solution (Recommended)

Run this single command to fix most warnings automatically:

```
/eslint-warning-orchestrator
```

This will:
1. Analyze all 1000+ warnings
2. Run each specialized agent in the correct order
3. Generate a detailed report
4. Reduce warnings to <50

## 🎯 What Gets Fixed

| Warning Type | Count | Agent | What It Does |
|-------------|-------|-------|--------------|
| Unused imports | ~400 | unused-import-cleanup | Removes imports not used in code |
| Unescaped entities | ~300 | jsx-entity-escaper | Fixes quotes/apostrophes in JSX |
| Any types | ~200 | typescript-type-improver | Adds proper TypeScript types |
| Hook dependencies | ~50 | react-hook-dependency-fixer | Adds missing useEffect deps |
| Unused variables | ~50 | unused-import-cleanup | Removes unused declarations |

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

- Full orchestration: 5-10 minutes
- Individual agents: 1-3 minutes each

## 🔍 Verify Results

After running, check the build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## 💡 Tips

1. The orchestrator is smart - it prevents conflicts between fixes
2. All changes are safe - no functionality will break
3. Review the final report for any manual fixes needed
4. Commit the changes after verification

## 🛠️ Manual Intervention

Some warnings may require manual fixes:
- Complex type inference cases
- Intentional any types
- Special hook dependency patterns
- Code that needs refactoring

The final report will highlight these cases.
