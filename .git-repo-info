This directory is now connected to: https://github.com/SteppieD/painttest4

The directory name is still "painttest3" but it's actually working with the painttest4 repository.
Origin remote now points to painttest4.

To avoid confusion:
- This is the ACTIVE repository that Vercel deploys from
- All changes should be pushed to painttest4
- The painttest3 repository is no longer in use

Current branch: main (not master)
