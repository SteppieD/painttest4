# Task Completion Checklist

When completing any coding task in this project, ensure you:

## 1. Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` to ensure TypeScript types are correct
- [ ] Fix any warnings or errors before considering the task complete

## 2. Testing
- [ ] Manually test the feature in the browser at http://localhost:3001
- [ ] Test on both desktop and mobile viewports
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors

## 3. Code Review
- [ ] Ensure code follows the established patterns in the codebase
- [ ] Use Tailwind CSS utilities (no inline styles)
- [ ] Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- [ ] Use functional components with hooks
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

## 4. Git Workflow
- [ ] Work on a feature branch (never directly on main)
- [ ] Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, etc.)

## 5. Documentation
- [ ] Update relevant documentation if needed
- [ ] Add comments only if explicitly requested
