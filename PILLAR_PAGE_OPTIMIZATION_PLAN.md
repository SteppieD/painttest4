**Action Items**:
```
For "How to Quote Painting Jobs" Pillar:

```

### 2. Featured Snippet Optimization

**Current Opportunities**:

**"How to Quote Painting Jobs" - Target Snippets**:
- "What is included in a painting quote" (paragraph)
- "How to calculate paint coverage" (table)
- "Steps to create a painting estimate" (list)
- "Average painting costs per square foot" (table)

**Implementation**:
```html
<h2>What is Included in a Professional Painting Quote?</h2>
<p>A professional painting quote includes detailed scope of work, 
material specifications with quantities and brands, labor hours 
and rates, project timeline, payment terms, and warranty 
information. The quote should clearly outline what's included 
and excluded from the project scope.</p>
<!-- 40-60 words, directly answers the question -->
```
