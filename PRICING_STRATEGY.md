# PaintQuote Pro Pricing Strategy

## Current State (August 2024)
- **Free Tier**: 5 quotes/month - $0
- **Professional Tier**: Unlimited quotes - $79/month or $790/year
- ~~Business Tier~~ - REMOVED (was $149/month)

## Why We Removed the Business Tier
After competitive analysis, we found:
1. **No clear value proposition** - Multiple users isn't valuable with our access code system
2. **Target market mismatch** - 75% of painting companies have 1-4 employees with one person doing quotes
3. **Better opportunity** - Modular add-ons provide more flexibility and value

## Future Pricing Strategy: Add-On Model

Instead of a fixed "Business" tier, we'll offer modular add-ons that users can mix and match:

### Planned Add-Ons (To Be Implemented)

#### 1. **Material Cost Integration** (+$29/month)
- Live pricing from Sherwin-Williams API
- Benjamin Moore pricing integration
- Automatic material cost updates
- Supplier inventory checking
- **Implementation Priority**: HIGH
- **Estimated Dev Time**: 2-3 weeks

#### 2. **Advanced Analytics** (+$39/month)
- Profit margin analysis by job type
- Seasonal demand forecasting
- Win/loss analysis with insights
- Customer lifetime value tracking
- Crew performance metrics
- **Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Estimated Dev Time**: 3-4 weeks

#### 3. **White Label** (+$49/month)
- Remove PaintQuote Pro branding
- Custom domain for client portal
- Your logo on all quotes
- Custom email templates
- **Implementation Priority**: LOW
- **Estimated Dev Time**: 1-2 weeks

#### 4. **Premium Integrations** (+$39/month)
- QuickBooks two-way sync
- Google Calendar scheduling
- Zapier premium workflows
- Slack notifications
- **Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Estimated Dev Time**: 4-5 weeks

### Revenue Projections
- **Average customer**: $79 base + 1-2 add-ons = $118-137/month
- **Power users**: $79 base + all add-ons = $186/month
- **Achieves "Business tier" revenue without complexity**

## Competitive Advantages
- **Simpler than competitors** - Two tiers vs complex pricing
- **More flexible** - Pick only what you need
- **Better value** - $79 entry vs $179+ competitors
- **Painting-specific** - Not generic field service software

## Key Metrics to Track
- Add-on adoption rate

## Notes for Development
- Keep add-ons modular and independent
- Use feature flags for easy enable/disable

- Consider bundle discounts later
