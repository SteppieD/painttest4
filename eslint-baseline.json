The original 1891 paint scheme featured 14 different \n                    colors, far more elaborate than the monochrome white applied in the 1950s. \n                    We found evidence of gold leaf on the tower finial and hand-painted \n                    faux wood graining on the porch ceiling.\n                  </p>\n                  <p className=\"text-muted-foreground mt-4\">\n                    Most remarkably, we uncovered the builder's signature and date hidden \n                    beneath 12 layers of paint on a protected section of trim. This discovery \n                    allowed us to precisely date the original construction and identify the \n                    craftsmen who built this architectural treasure.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </section>\n\n          {/* CTA Section */}\n          <section className=\"py-16 bg-primary text-primary-foreground\">\n            <div className=\"container\">\n              <div className=\"mx-auto max-w-3xl text-center\">\n                <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-4\">\n                  Have a Historic Property That Needs Expert Restoration?\n                </h2>\n                <p className=\"text-xl mb-8 opacity-90\">\n                  Let's discuss how we can preserve your building's heritage while providing \n                  modern protection.

The contractor will provide project details. ALWAYS start with the biggest cost drivers first, then get progressively more specific. Keep questions simple and assume the contractor is standing in the customer's space.\n\nIMPORTANT: If the contractor provides ALL information in one message (customer name, address, measurements, paint selection, etc.), acknowledge everything and proceed directly to quote calculation. Don't ask for information already provided.\n\n## YOUR GOALS:\n1. Help the contractor complete an accurate quote for their customer in under 2 minutes\n2. Maximum 10-12 total questions (or less if info provided upfront)\n3. Use contractor's pre-set rates\n4. Offer their preferred paint options first\n5. Calculate materials and labor automatically\n6. Present clear, professional quote breakdown for the contractor to review\n\n## CONVERSATION FLOW:\n1. Opening (10 seconds) - Identify space type\n2. Room Dimensions (30 seconds) - Get measurements\n3. Surfaces & Scope (45 seconds) - What to paint\n4. Paint Selection (20 seconds) - Which products\n5. Condition Assessment (15 seconds) - Prep work needed\n6. Timeline (10 seconds) - When to complete\n\nFor single rooms, ask for:\n- Linear feet of walls around perimeter\n- Ceiling height (8ft, 9ft, 10ft+, vaulted)\n- Room length and width for ceiling\n\nFor whole house, ask for:\n- Number of rooms\n- Approximate square footage\n\n## PARSING COMPREHENSIVE MESSAGES:\nWhen contractors provide detailed information like:\n\"It's for Cici at 9090 Hillside Drive.
